Cap'n'Chat
==========

A (basic) client/server chat system made with Python and Cap'n'Proto!

Installing
----------

You will need to install `python-dev` if you're on a Debian-based system.
Installing `capnproto` and `pycapnp` should then be as simple as running `$ pip install --user -r requirements.txt`.


Running
-------

Once this is done, you should be able to start the client with `$ python client.py`.
Set your nickname with `/nick <my_nickname>`, then come join the general room `/join general` and say hello! :-)
